🗓 DAY 1 — Spring Boot Basics & Bootstrapping

❓ What is Spring Boot?
✅ Answer:
Spring Boot is an opinionated framework that simplifies Spring application development by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers, and production-ready features.

❓ What problems does Spring Boot solve?
✅ Answer:
- Eliminates boilerplate configuration
- No need for external application servers
- Simplifies dependency management
- Faster application startup

❓ What is @SpringBootApplication?
✅ Answer:
It is a composite annotation that includes:
- @Configuration
- @EnableAutoConfiguration
- @ComponentScan

❓ What happens when a Spring Boot application starts?
“SpringApplication.run() bootstraps the application, creates the ApplicationContext, performs classpath scanning, applies auto-configurations, and starts the embedded server.”✅ Answer:
- Application context is created
- Auto-configuration is applied
- Beans are scanned and registered
- Embedded server (Tomcat) starts
- Application is ready to accept requests

❓ What is embedded Tomcat?
✅ Answer:
An embedded servlet container bundled with Spring Boot, allowing applications to run as standalone JARs without deploying to external servers.

❓ Difference between Spring and Spring Boot?
✅ Answer:
| Feature | Spring | Spring Boot |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Configuration | Requires manual config | Auto-configuration |
| Server | External server needed | Embedded server |
| Approach | XML-heavy | Java & annotation-based |

❓ What is Spring Initializr?
✅ Answer:
A tool to generate Spring Boot projects with predefined dependencies and project structure.

❓ How does Spring Boot know which packages to scan?
✅ Answer:
By default, it scans the package of the main class and all its sub-packages.

---

🗓 DAY 2 — Layered Architecture, DTO & Entity

❓ What is layered architecture in Spring Boot?
✅ Answer:
A design pattern that separates responsibilities into layers:
- Controller Layer (HTTP handling)
- Service Layer (Business logic)
- Repository Layer (Data access)

❓ Why do we need a Service layer?
✅ Answer:
To encapsulate business logic and prevent controllers from becoming fat and unmaintainable.

❓ Why should controllers not contain business logic?
✅ Answer:
Because controllers should handle HTTP concerns only and delegate business logic to services for better maintainability and testability.

❓ What is a DTO?
✅ Answer:
A Data Transfer Object used to transfer data between layers, especially between client and server, without exposing internal domain models.

❓ Why should we not expose Entity directly in APIs?
✅ Answer:
- Security risks (over-posting attacks)
- Tight coupling with database schema
- API breaks when database structure changes

❓ Why do we accept DTO in @RequestBody?
✅ Answer:
Because DTO defines the API contract and protects internal domain models from client manipulation.

❓ Why is DTO placed in Service layer and not Repository?
✅ Answer:
Repositories deal only with entities and persistence, while DTOs are used for business logic and data transfer between client and server.
DTOs belong to the API and business layers, while repositories operate strictly on persistence models (Entities). Mixing DTOs with repositories violates separation of concerns.

❓ Can we use Entity directly for small projects?
✅ Answer:
Yes, but it violates clean architecture principles and becomes hard to maintain as the application grows.

---

🗓 DAY 3 — Jackson, DTO Design & Deserialization

❓ How does Spring convert JSON to Java objects?
✅ Answer:
Spring uses Jackson's ObjectMapper internally to deserialize JSON into Java objects based on property names and types.

❓ What is @RequestBody?
✅ Answer:
It binds the HTTP request body to a Java object using HTTP message converters, automatically parsing JSON/XML to Java objects.

❓ Why do DTOs require a no-args constructor?
✅ Answer:
Jackson uses reflection to instantiate objects and requires a default constructor unless configured otherwise with custom deserialization logic.

❓ Why setters are required in DTO?
✅ Answer:
Jackson populates object fields using setters or direct field access during deserialization of incoming JSON data.
Jackson requires either setters, public fields, or field access (via reflection). Setters are preferred for encapsulation and flexibility.

❓ Difference between primitive and wrapper types in DTO?
✅ Answer:
| Feature | Primitive | Wrapper |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Null value | Cannot be null | Can be null |
| API safety | Causes deserialization errors | Safe for APIs |
| Default value | Has default value | null by default |

❓ Why should DTO fields use wrapper types?
✅ Answer:
Because incoming JSON may omit fields, and wrapper types allow null values without causing deserialization errors.

❓ What causes ClassNotFoundException vs NoClassDefFoundError?
✅ Answer:
- ClassNotFoundException: Class not found during dynamic loading at runtime
- NoClassDefFoundError: Class present at compile time but missing at runtime

❓ Why did we get JSON parse error for long id?
✅ Answer:
Because Jackson cannot assign null to primitive types when the client does not send the field. Use Long (wrapper) instead of long (primitive).

❓ Should client send id during create API?
✅ Answer:
No. ID should be generated by the database (auto-increment), not the client. Client should omit the id field during creation.

---

🗓 DAY 4 — Bean Validation & Global Exception Handling

❓ What does @Valid do?
✅ Answer:
@Valid triggers bean validation before the controller method is executed. If validation fails, a MethodArgumentNotValidException is thrown.

❓ Where does validation failure occur?
✅ Answer:
During argument resolution phase, before entering the controller method body. Spring intercepts the request at this stage.

❓ Why 400 and not 500?
✅ Answer:
Validation errors are client-side input errors, not server failures. HTTP 400 (Bad Request) indicates the client sent invalid data, while 500 (Internal Server Error) indicates a server-side failure.

❓ Difference between @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler?
✅ Answer:
- @ExceptionHandler: Handles exceptions locally within a specific controller
- @RestControllerAdvice: Applies exception handling globally across all controllers in the application

❓ Why not validate in service layer?
✅ Answer:
Validation is a boundary concern that should occur at the entry point of your application. The service layer assumes it receives valid input and focuses on business logic rather than input validation.
“Service layer validation is business validation; input validation belongs to the boundary (controller).”

❓ What is @RestControllerAdvice?
✅ Answer:
A composite annotation combining @ControllerAdvice with @ResponseBody. It centralizes exception handling across controllers and automatically serializes exception responses to JSON.

❓ Why use @NotBlank instead of @NotNull?
✅ Answer:
- @NotNull: Allows empty strings and whitespace
- @NotBlank: Rejects null, empty strings, and whitespace-only strings for better data quality

❓ What happens when validation fails?
✅ Answer:
Spring catches the exception, calls the appropriate @ExceptionHandler method, and returns a structured error response with HTTP 400 status and validation error details.



🗓 DAY 5 — REST APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) + PathVariable & RequestParam

❓ What is a REST API?
✅ Answer:
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style where resources are accessed using HTTP methods. A REST API is stateless, uses standard HTTP methods, and operates on resources rather than actions.

Example:
- GET /employees
- GET /employees/101
- POST /employees
- PUT /employees/101
- DELETE /employees/101

❓ Difference between HTTP Methods?
✅ Answer:
| Method | Purpose | Idempotent | Used for |
|--------|---------|------------|----------|
| GET | Fetch data | ✅ Yes | Read |
| POST | Create data | ❌ No | Create |
| PUT | Update entire resource | ✅ Yes | Update |
| PATCH | Partial update | ❌ No | Partial update |
| DELETE | Delete resource | ✅ Yes | Delete |

❓ What does idempotent mean?
✅ Answer:
An operation is idempotent if calling it multiple times produces the same result as calling it once. GET, PUT, and DELETE are idempotent; POST and PATCH are not.

❓ What is @PathVariable?
✅ Answer:
@PathVariable extracts variable values from the URL path. Example: In /employees/{id}, @PathVariable Long id captures the id value from the URL.

❓ What is @RequestParam?
✅ Answer:
@RequestParam extracts query parameters from the URL. Example: /employees?department=IT extracts the department parameter from the query string.

❓ Difference between @PathVariable and @RequestParam?
✅ Answer:
| Feature | @PathVariable | @RequestParam |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Location | URL path | Query string |
| Purpose | Resource identifier | Filtering/filtering |
| Required | Usually mandatory | Optional by default |
| Example | /employees/101 | /employees?department=IT |

❓ Why use PathVariable for ID and RequestParam for filters?
✅ Answer:
PathVariable identifies the specific resource (unique),  while RequestParam provides optional filtering or sorting criteria to query parameters.

❓ What is HTTP idempotency used for?
✅ Answer:
Idempotency ensures that retrying a request (due to network failures) does not cause unintended side effects. Safe methods like GET and PUT can be safely retried.

❓ Why is POST not idempotent?
✅ Answer:
Because calling POST multiple times creates multiple resources, each call produces a different result (new ID), making it non-idempotent.


❓ What HTTP status code should POST return?
✅ Answer:
HTTP 201 (Created) indicates successful resource creation. The response should include the created resource and its location header.

❓ What HTTP status code should GET return?
✅ Answer:
HTTP 200 (OK) indicates successful retrieval of requested data.

❓ What is request body?
✅ Answer:
Binds incoming JSON request body to a Java object using Jackson.
    @PostMapping("/employees")
    public EmployeeDto create(@RequestBody EmployeeDto dto)

❓ Why POST uses @RequestBody but GET doesn’t?
✅ Answer:
GET requests should not have body
POST sends data in body for creation

❓ Why do we use separate HTTP methods instead of one endpoint?
✅ Answer:
Because REST follows uniform interface constraints and improves clarity, caching, and semantics.

❓ Why PUT is idempotent?
✅ Answer:
Calling PUT multiple times with same data results in same state.

❓ Can GET have a request body?
✅ Answer:
Technically possible but not recommended and not supported by Spring.

❓ Why @RestController instead of @Controller?
✅ Answer:
@RestController combines @Controller + @ResponseBody.

❓ Why constructor injection is preferred?
✅ Answer:
Immutability
Better testability
Avoids null beans

❓ What is PATCH?

✅ Answer (Interview-ready):
PATCH is an HTTP method used to partially update a resource.
Unlike PUT, which replaces the entire resource, PATCH modifies only the specified fields.


🗓 DAY 6 — Spring Boot JPA & Database Integration

❓ What is JPA?
✅ Answer:
JPA (Java Persistence API) is a Java specification for managing relational data in applications using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
Maps Java objects → database tables
Allows CRUD operations without writing SQL manually
Spring Boot uses Spring Data JPA as its implementation (usually Hibernate by default).

❓ Difference between JPA and Hibernate
Feature	                    JPA	            Hibernate
Type	                Specification	Implementation of JPA
Vendor	                Standard API	Specific ORM library
Requirement	Needs       JPA provider	Provides full JPA + extra features
Portability	                High	    Less portable if using Hibernate-specific features

❓ What is an Entity?
✅ Answer:
A Java class annotated with @Entity representing a database table.
Fields map to table columns.
Requires a primary key annotated with @Id.

❓ What is a Repository?
✅ Answer:
Interface to handle database operations using JPA.
Extends Spring Data interfaces like JpaRepository or CrudRepository.
Spring Boot automatically generates the implementation at runtime.

❓ Why use Spring Data JPA?
✅ Answer:
Reduces boilerplate code
Provides ready-to-use methods: save(), findById(), findAll(), deleteById()
Supports derived queries (method names define SQL)
Integrates with transactions and paging/sorting easily

❓ Difference between CrudRepository and JpaRepository
Feature	                    CrudRepository	                    JpaRepository
CRUD methods	    ✅ save, findAll, findById, delete	      ✅ All + batch save, flush, pagination
Pagination & Sorting	    ❌ Limited	                      ✅ Full support
Custom Queries	            ✅ JPQL or derived	              ✅ JPQL, derived, native SQL


❓ What is @GeneratedValue?
✅ Answer:
Defines automatic ID generation strategy for primary key:
IDENTITY → Auto-increment (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
SEQUENCE → Uses DB sequence
AUTO → Spring picks default strategy
TABLE → Uses a table to simulate sequence


❓ Transaction Management
✅ Answer:
Spring Boot manages transactions automatically using @Transactional.
CRUD operations in JPA are transactional.
Ensures atomicity: all changes succeed or fail together.

❓ Why DTO instead of Entity in APIs?
✅ Answer is the same as Day 2/3:
Security: prevents exposing DB schema
Loose coupling: API evolves independently from DB
Better validation and mapping

❓ Why use JPA instead of JDBC?
✅ Answer:
JPA provides object-relational mapping, so you can work with objects instead of SQL queries.
Handles connection management, caching, lazy loading automatically.
Supports database portability without changing code (use same entities for MySQL, Postgres, etc.)
Reduces boilerplate like ResultSet parsing, PreparedStatement setup, exception handling.

❓ What is @GeneratedValue?
✅ Answer (additional details):
Can define strategy per database to optimize inserts.
Can combine with @SequenceGenerator or @TableGenerator for custom ID generation rules.
Supports UUID, custom sequences beyond numeric auto-increment.

❓ What does spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update do?
✅ Answer:
Automatically updates database schema to match entity definitions.
Does not delete data; only adds or alters columns/tables.
Useful in development, but should not be used in production (risk of data loss).
Other options:
validate → checks schema matches entities, no changes
create → drops & recreates schema every startup
create-drop → same as create, drops schema on shutdown

❓ How does Spring Boot create repository implementation automatically?
✅ Answer:
Spring Data uses dynamic proxies to generate a class at runtime that implements your repository interface.
The generated class handles CRUD operations, query methods, pagination, and sorting.
Custom methods with derived queries (like findByName) are parsed by Spring, and the appropriate JPQL query is generated automatically.

❓ What is the advantage of service layer in JPA?
✅ Answer:
Encapsulates transaction boundaries using @Transactional.
Provides a place to add business logic, so repository stays focused on persistence only.
Makes code testable, as services can be mocked independently of DB.
Reduces tightly coupled controllers, promoting clean architecture.

❓ Difference between save() for new entity vs existing entity?
✅ Answer:
New entity (no ID assigned / null ID):
save() performs an INSERT into the database.
JPA sets the generated ID back on the entity.
Existing entity (ID present and managed):
save() performs an UPDATE.
Only changes in entity fields are persisted.
Key point: JPA decides INSERT vs UPDATE based on entity identity and persistence context.


🗓 DAY 7 — Spring Security: Basic Authentication
❓ What is Spring Security?
✅ Answer:
Spring Security is a framework that provides authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks for Spring applications.
It secures:
Who you are → Authentication
What you can do → Authorization
It works as a filter chain in front of your Spring Boot controllers.

❓ What happens when Spring Security is added to a project?
✅ Answer:
The moment you add the spring-boot-starter-security dependency:
All endpoints become secured
A login form is auto-generated
A default user is created
Password is printed in logs
You must authenticate to access any endpoint
This is called secure by default.

❓ What is Authentication?
✅ Answer:
Authentication is the process of verifying who the user is.
Examples:
Username + Password
Token (JWT)
OAuth login
If identity is verified → user is authenticated.

❓ What is Authorization?
✅ Answer:
Authorization decides what an authenticated user is allowed to do.
Example:
Admin → can delete users
Normal user → can only view data
Authentication comes first, authorization comes after.

❓ What is Basic Authentication?
✅ Answer:
Basic Authentication is an HTTP-based authentication scheme where:
Username and password are sent in every request
Encoded using Base64
Header:
Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)
It is:
Simple
Stateless
Not secure without HTTPS


❓ Why is Basic Auth considered weak?
✅ Answer:
Because:
Credentials are sent on every request
Base64 is NOT encryption (easily decoded)
If HTTPS is not used, credentials can be stolen
So it is only used for:
Internal services
Prototypes
Learning security

❓ How does Spring Security process a request?
✅ Answer:
Spring Security uses a Filter Chain:
Request comes in
Security filters run
Authentication happens
Authorization happens
If allowed → controller is called
If not → 401 or 403 returned
Your controller never sees unauthorized requests.

❓ What is a Security Filter Chain?
✅ Answer:
A sequence of security filters that intercept every HTTP request before it reaches controllers.
It handles:
Login
Authentication
CSRF(Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a web security vulnerability where attackers trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions (like changing passwords or making purchases) on a trusted website without their consent, by exploiting the browser's automatic sending of session cookies.
Authorization
Logout
Session management

❓ What is UserDetailsService?
✅ Answer:
It is the interface Spring Security uses to load user data.

Spring calls:
loadUserByUsername(username)

It must return:
Username
Password
Roles
Spring never talks directly to DB — it talks through this interface.

❓ What is AuthenticationManager?
✅ Answer:
It is the core component that:
Takes username + password
Uses UserDetailsService
Uses PasswordEncoder
Decides if login is valid
It is the brain of authentication.

❓ What is PasswordEncoder?
✅ Answer:
Used to hash and verify passwords.
Spring never stores plain passwords.
It compares hashed passwords.
Example:
BCryptPasswordEncoder

❓ What is the difference between 401 and 403?
✅ Answer:
Code	Meaning
401	Not authenticated (no login)
403	Authenticated but not allowed

❓ @Configuration
✅ Answer:
The @Configuration annotation is a core Spring annotation used to declare a class as a source of bean definitions for the Spring application context. 
It indicates that the class contains methods annotated with @Bean, which will be processed by the Spring container to generate beans and wire dependencies. 
This allows you to define your application's structure using Java instead of XML. 

❓ @EnableWebSecurity 
✅ Answer:
The @EnableWebSecurity annotation is a specialized Spring Security annotation. Its primary functions are: 
Enables Web Security: It activates Spring Security's web security support.
Sets up the Filter Chain: It sets up the FilterChainProxy, which is the core filter that intercepts incoming HTTP requests and applies the necessary security rules.
Imports Core Configuration: It imports the WebSecurityConfiguration class internally, which exports necessary beans and provides a foundation for security customization. 

🗓 DAY 8 — JWT Authentication 
❓ What is JWT?
✅ Answer (Interview-ready):
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe token used to securely transmit claims between client and server.
It is stateless, meaning the server does not store session data.

❓ Why JWT over Basic Authentication?
✅ Answer:
Basic Auth                                  	JWT
Credentials sent on every request	 |    Token sent instead
Stateful / less scalable	         |    Stateless & scalable
Not suitable for microservices	     |    Ideal for microservices
No expiration control	             |    Supports expiry & refresh


❓ What does “stateless authentication” mean?
✅ Answer:
The server does not store user session data.
Each request carries all authentication information inside the JWT.

❓ Structure of JWT?
✅ Answer:
JWT has 3 parts, separated by dots:
HEADER.PAYLOAD.SIGNATURE
Header → Algorithm & token type
Payload → Claims (username, roles, expiry)
Signature → Verifies token integrity

❓ How JWT authentication flow works?
✅ Answer:
Client sends username + password to /login
Server validates credentials
Server generates JWT
Client stores JWT (header/local storage)
Client sends JWT in Authorization header
Server validates JWT for every request

❓ Where is JWT sent in request?
✅ Answer:
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

❓ Why JWT is preferred in microservices?
✅ Answer:
No session replication
Works across services
Lightweight
Scales horizontally

❓ Can JWT be revoked?
✅ Answer:
Not directly (stateless).
Solutions:
Short expiry
Token blacklist
Refresh tokens

🗓 DAY 9 — API Versioning + HATEOAS

❓ Why is API versioning needed?
✅ Answer:
API versioning is required to maintain backward compatibility. When you update an API, existing clients may break if the old endpoints are modified. Versioning ensures:
Existing clients continue to work
New features can be added safely
Deprecation of old functionality can be handled gradually

❓ What are the common API versioning strategies?
✅ Answer:
URI Versioning
Example: /api/v1/employees
Version is part of the URL
Pros: Simple, easy to test
Cons: URL changes for every version

Request Parameter Versioning
Example: /employees?version=1
Pros: Flexible, no URL changes
Cons: Not cache-friendly, less intuitive

Header Versioning
Example: X-API-VERSION: 1
Pros: Clean URL, no query params
Cons: Harder to test via browser

Media Type / Accept Header Versioning
Example: Accept: application/vnd.company.v1+json
Pros: Pure REST approach
Cons: Complex, rarely used

❓ Which versioning approach is most commonly used?
✅ Answer:
URI Versioning is most common in real-world projects.
Header and media type versioning are more REST-pure but less practical.
Interviews often ask both: pros/cons and “how to implement in Spring Boot.”

❓ How do you implement API versioning in Spring Boot?
✅ Answer:
URI versioning: Define separate endpoints per version in the controller.
@GetMapping("/api/v1/employees")
public List<EmployeeDto> getEmployeesV1() { ... }
@GetMapping("/api/v2/employees")
public List<EmployeeDto> getEmployeesV2() { ... }


Header versioning: Use @RequestMapping with headers attribute.
@GetMapping(value = "/employees", headers = "X-API-VERSION=1")
public List<EmployeeDto> getEmployeesV1() { ... }

Media type versioning: Use produces attribute.
@GetMapping(value = "/employees", produces = "application/vnd.company.v1+json")
public List<EmployeeDto> getEmployeesV1() { ... }


HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)
❓ What is HATEOAS?
✅ Answer:
HATEOAS is a REST principle where the API response contains links to related resources.
It allows clients to navigate the API dynamically
Reduces hard-coded endpoint knowledge on the client
Example:
{
  "id": 101,
  "name": "Ajay",
  "_links": {
    "self": { "href": "/api/v1/employees/101" },
    "all-employees": { "href": "/api/v1/employees" }
  }
}


❓ Why HATEOAS is rarely used but often asked in interviews?
✅ Answer:
Rare in real-world projects because: extra overhead, most clients know endpoints, simpler REST works fine
Popular in interviews to test understanding of REST maturity levels

❓ What are the benefits of HATEOAS?
✅ Answer:
Clients don’t hardcode URLs
API can evolve independently
Supports discoverability of resources
Aligns with Richardson Maturity Level 3 (fully RESTful)

❓ How do you implement HATEOAS in Spring Boot?
✅ Answer:
Use spring-boot-starter-hateoas dependency
Wrap responses in EntityModel or CollectionModel
Add links using WebMvcLinkBuilder

Example:
@GetMapping("/employees/{id}")
public EntityModel<EmployeeDto> getEmployee(@PathVariable Long id) {
    EmployeeDto employee = service.findById(id);
    return EntityModel.of(employee,
        linkTo(methodOn(EmployeeController.class).getEmployee(id)).withSelfRel(),
        linkTo(methodOn(EmployeeController.class).getAllEmployees()).withRel("all-employees"));
}


❓ Difference between normal REST and HATEOAS REST?
✅ Answer:
Feature	                Normal REST	                HATEOAS REST
Links	            No links in response	    Response contains navigable links
Client knowledge	Hardcoded endpoints	        Clients discover endpoints dynamically
REST maturity	        Level 2	                Level 3 (Richardson Maturity Model)

❓ Interview tip for HATEOAS:
✅ Answer:
Explain the principle, give JSON example, mention Spring HATEOAS classes like EntityModel, CollectionModel, WebMvcLinkBuilder.
Highlight that it improves discoverability and aligns with Level 3 REST.

📅 DAY 10 — MySQL + JPQL + Native Queries
❓ Why do we use MySQL with Spring Boot instead of H2?
✅ Answer:
MySQL is production-grade RDBMS, H2 is in-memory mainly for testing/dev.

❓ What properties are required to connect Spring Boot to MySQL?
✅ Answer:
spring.datasource.url
spring.datasource.username
spring.datasource.password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto
spring.jpa.database-platform

❓ What does spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto do?
✅ Answer:
Controls DB schema generation (none, update, create, create-drop).

❓ What is JPQL?
✅ Answer:
Object-oriented query language that works on entities and fields, not tables.

❓ Difference between JPQL and SQL?
✅ Answer:
JPQL works on entities, SQL works on tables.

❓ Example of JPQL query?
✅ Answer:
@Query("SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.department = :dept")
List<Employee> findByDepartment(String dept);

❓ Can JPQL perform joins?
✅ Answer:
Yes.

❓ Does JPQL support aggregation functions?
✅ Answer:
Yes (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX).

❓ What is a native query?
✅ Answer:
DB-specific SQL query executed directly on database.

❓ When should native queries be used?
✅ Answer:
Complex queries, DB-specific features, performance optimization.

❓ Example of native query?
✅ Answer:
@Query(value = "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = ?1", nativeQuery = true)
List<Employee> findByDeptNative(String dept);

❓ Which annotation is used for custom queries?
✅ Answer:
@Query

❓ Difference between positional and named parameters?
✅ Answer:
Positional uses ?1, named uses :name.

❓ Can JPQL and native queries be used in same repository?
✅ Answer:
Yes.

❓ What is projection in JPA?
✅ Answer:
Fetching partial data instead of full entity.

❓ What is DTO mapping in queries?
✅ Answer:
Mapping query result directly to DTO object.

❓ What happens if DB column names don’t match entity fields in native query?
✅ Answer:
Mapping fails unless @Column(name="") or projection/DTO mapping is used.

❓ Is JPQL database independent?
✅ Answer:
Yes.

❓ Is native query database independent?
✅ Answer:
No.

❓ Which is preferred for portability?
✅ Answer:
JPQL.

❓ Which is preferred for performance tuning?
✅ Answer:
Native Query.

❓ What is JPQL?
✅ Answer:
JPQL is an object-oriented query language used in JPA.
It works on Entity objects and their fields, not on database tables or columns.

👉 JPQL is database-independent.

❓ What does JPQL query over?
✅ Answer:
JPQL queries:
Entities (Java classes)
Entity fields (Java properties)
❌ It does NOT use:
Table names
Column names
❓ Basic JPQL example – fetch all employees
✅ Answer:

@Query("SELECT e FROM Employee e")
List<Employee> findAllEmployees();
✔ Employee → Entity name
✔ e → alias
✔ returns managed entities

❓ JPQL example with WHERE condition
✅ Answer:

@Query("SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.department = :dept")
List<Employee> findByDepartment(@Param("dept") String dept);
✔ Uses entity field names
✔ Supports named parameters

❓ JPQL example using method name vs @Query
✅ Answer:
Method name:
List<Employee> findByDepartment(String department);

JPQL:
@Query("SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.department = :department")
List<Employee> fetchByDepartment(@Param("department") String department);


👉 Both generate JPQL internally

❓ JPQL example with projection (DTO)
✅ Answer:
@Query("SELECT new com.example.dto.EmployeeDto(e.id, e.name) FROM Employee e")
List<EmployeeDto> fetchEmployeeDtos();
✔ Avoids sending full entity
✔ Faster & API-safe

❓ Is JPQL translated to SQL?
✅ Answer:
Yes.
Hibernate converts JPQL → SQL based on the database dialect (MySQL, Postgres, etc.).

4️⃣ Native SQL Queries

❓ What is a Native Query?
✅ Answer:
A native query is pure SQL, written exactly as it would run in the database.

👉 Uses table names and column names

❓ Native query example
✅ Answer:
@Query(value = "SELECT * FROM employee WHERE department = ?1", nativeQuery = true)
List<Employee> findByDepartmentNative(String department);
✔ Uses table name employee
✔ Uses column department
✔ nativeQuery = true is mandatory

❓ Native query with named parameters
✅ Answer:
@Query(
  value = "SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > :salary",
  nativeQuery = true
)
List<Employee> findHighSalary(@Param("salary") double salary);


❓ Native query returning partial columns
✅ Answer:
@Query(
  value = "SELECT name, department FROM employee",
  nativeQuery = true
)
List<Object[]> fetchNameAndDepartment();

⚠ Requires manual mapping
⚠ Less type-safe

❓ Can native queries return DTO directly?
✅ Answer:
Yes, but requires:

Interface-based projection or

@SqlResultSetMapping (advanced)

👉 JPQL is simpler for DTOs

❓ Why native queries are faster sometimes?
✅ Answer:
Because:

No ORM abstraction

Direct DB execution

Can use DB-specific optimizations

5️⃣ JPQL vs Native Query (Interview Gold)

❓ JPQL vs Native SQL — key difference
✅ Answer:
Feature	           JPQL	      Native SQL
Works on	       Entities	    Tables
DB portability	  ✅ High	    ❌ Low
Compile-time safety	✅ Better 	❌ Less
ORM features	    ✅ Yes	      ❌ Limited
Performance tuning	❌ Limited	✅ Full

❓ When should you use JPQL?
✅ Answer:
Use JPQL when:
Query is entity-centric
Database portability matters
You want cleaner, safer code
DTO projections are required
👉 Default choice

❓ When should you use Native SQL?
✅ Answer:
Use Native queries when:
Complex joins / window functions
Vendor-specific SQL
Performance-critical queries
Legacy database queries

❓ Interview question:
“Which one do you prefer — JPQL or Native?”
✅ Answer:
“I prefer JPQL by default for portability and maintainability.
I use **native queries only when JPQL cannot express the required logic or for performance-critical cases.”

❓ Does Spring Data JPA encourage native queries?
✅ Answer:
No.
Spring Data JPA encourages:
1️⃣ Derived queries
2️⃣ JPQL
3️⃣ Native queries (last option)

❓ Can JPQL replace all SQL?
✅ Answer:
No.
JPQL cannot handle:
DB-specific functions
Advanced analytics queries
Stored procedures efficiently

📁 PROJECT STRUCTURE (Correct Design)
service
 ├── EmployeeService.java        <-- INTERFACE
 └── impl
     └── EmployeeServiceImpl.java <-- IMPLEMENTATION

🔵 EmployeeService (INTERFACE)

📄 EmployeeService.java
public interface EmployeeService {
    List<EmployeeDto> getAll();
    EmployeeDto getById(Long id);
    EmployeeDto create(EmployeeDto dto);
}


🔹 NO @Service here
🔹 NO business logic
🔹 Just contract

🟢 EmployeeServiceImpl (IMPLEMENTATION)
📄 EmployeeServiceImpl.java

@Service
public class EmployeeServiceImpl implements EmployeeService {

    private final EmployeeRepository repository;

    public EmployeeServiceImpl(EmployeeRepository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }

    @Override
    public List<EmployeeDto> getAll() {
        return repository.findAll();
    }

    @Override
    public EmployeeDto getById(Long id) {
        return repository.findById(id)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Not found"));
    }
}


🔹 @Service goes ONLY here
🔹 Spring registers this class as a bean

🔴 WHY CONTROLLER IMPORTS INTERFACE?

📄 EmployeeController.java

@RestController
public class EmployeeController {

    private final EmployeeService employeeService;

    public EmployeeController(EmployeeService employeeService) {
        this.employeeService = employeeService;
    }
}

❓ Why not EmployeeServiceImpl?
Because:
You don’t care HOW it works
You care WHAT it provides
Spring does:
EmployeeService  --->  EmployeeServiceImpl
automatically.

🧩 HOW SPRING RESOLVES THIS?
Controller asks for EmployeeService
Spring scans beans
Finds:
EmployeeServiceImpl implements EmployeeService

Injects it automatically
🔥 This is Dependency Injection
⚠️ WHAT IF MULTIPLE IMPLEMENTATIONS EXIST?

Example:
EmployeeServiceImpl
EmployeeServiceMockImpl


Then Spring gets confused.
✅ Solution:
@Primary
@Service
public class EmployeeServiceImpl implements EmployeeService


OR

@Autowired
@Qualifier("employeeServiceImpl")
EmployeeService service;

🎯 INTERVIEW READY ANSWER

Q: Why inject interface instead of implementation?
✅ Loose coupling
✅ Easy testing (Mockito)
✅ Swap implementations easily
✅ Follows SOLID principles

Q: Who decides which implementation is used?
✅ Spring IoC Container
